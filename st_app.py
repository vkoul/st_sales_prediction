    This is a simulated dataset for a Case Study to demonstrate the usage of Linear Regression to solve business problem. 
    
    The data spans 24 months and has `unit sales` along with the `price`, `advertisment spend` and `promotion spend`
    
    The predictions are based on a Linear Regression model . It is used to establish the relationship between the independent variables (price, promotion and advertisment) to predict the unit sales for each given scenario.
